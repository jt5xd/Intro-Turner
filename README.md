Hello all!

My name is Janelle Turner and I'm from St. Louis, Missouri. I got my BA in History and a minor in Library Science at Missouri State University. 

Since then I've been working at St. Louis County Library first as a Circulation Assistant, then a Library Assistant and currently an Adult Programming Assistant.

I'm looking to continue in this field and glad to meet you all. 

Random Personal stuff: I love photography, sci-fi, bad reality tv, yoga, hiking and audiobooks while doing chores. 

I'm excited to start this new journey!
